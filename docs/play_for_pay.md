# Play For Pay

A **bounty of $0.50 USD per added line of code** is available via Paypal (for now.)

- The number of line additions is clearly indicated on every commit page.
- Line deletions are counted only if they are greater than line addtions so, for example, 9 additions and 12 deletions will add up to $6 (9 + 3 * 50c).
- Because of the overhead of offshore payments, including exchange rate fees, a commiter who wants to receive a bounty has to get to at least $50 USD before payment will be transferred to their Paypal account.
- A public record of payments will be kept in the [Payment History] file so please advise if you would prefer to stay anonimous.
- Be warned, moving blocks of code around just to increase the commit line rate will not be honoured and may lead to the commiter being banned from "play for pay" for this project.
