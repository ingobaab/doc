One of the goals of this project is to keep the shell and web interface as simple as possible and the best way to achieve that, for now, is to use only `bash` for the shell scripts and `PHP` for the web interface. A significant point is that all server management can be done primarily via the shell scripts and that the web interface, wherever possible, is simply a wrapper around the functionality of the shell scripts.
